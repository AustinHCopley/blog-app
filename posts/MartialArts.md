## Martial Arts

I enjoy learning a lot about different martial arts styles. I currently train Muay Thai and while I don't have much training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, it is one of my favorite styles, and I have practiced a lot outside of formal settings with friends and my roommate who has been training for several years. The rules of each style within the competition setting, for the most part, is what determines how the style is applied. 

Muay Thai is a striking based fighting style originating in Thailand where fighters typically make use of punches, kicks, elbows, knees, and the clinch. Scoring is based on damage and perceived effect, so balance is a key aspect of any practitioner's game, opponents will try to break this down with the use of sweeps, and dumps. 

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, or BJJ, is a grappling based style where fighters have the ultimate goal of submitting their opponents through chokes, locks, and various submissions. 

Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA, is, as the name suggests, a sport where striking, grappling and wrestling are important aspects, and it is another one of my favorites, as many fighters are well versed in a multitude of different styles, and typically fighters who have experience in Muay Thai/Kickboxing, and BJJ/Wrestling are the most dangerous, and therefore the most successful.
